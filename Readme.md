#Carrizo Pathtracer


##What it is

Right now, nothing really, what will it be one day? A nice pathtracer, basically a raytracer that doesn't stop at the first bounce or so arbitrarily but considers the path of each ray of light to better model the lighting.

##What it does

Nothing right now really, it's quite incomplete. I think BVH traversal and creation is implemented but I have to test it further, then adding importing model support.
