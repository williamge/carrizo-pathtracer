#Carrizo Pathtracer


##What it is

Right now, nothing really, what will it be one day? A nice pathtracer, basically a raytracer that doesn't stop at the first bounce or so arbitrarily but considers the path of each ray of light to better model the lighting.

##What it does

So far it can create and traverse BVH structures, and computer intersections for triangles, but there's nothing set up to load objects or to shade them.

###List of things implemented
- Basic backend for rendering
- BVH creation
- BVH traversal
- Ray intersection

###Next steps to take
- Hook up the asset importer so there's something to see
